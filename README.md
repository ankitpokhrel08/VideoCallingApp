# Vite & Node.js Project

## Overview
This project is a real-time video calling application built using Vite for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Users can connect by entering an email and a room ID, and multiple users can join the same room to initiate a video call.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Vite (for the client-side)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)

> **Note:** Tailwind CSS is not running correctly at the moment and requires help with initialization.
